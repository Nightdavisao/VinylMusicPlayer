**A material designed local music player for Android.**
Stuff may be broken or not work as expected so beware before trying out this fork.

**Forked from [Phonograph](https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph); makes all Pro features free, as they used to be.**

## Download
Check [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nightdavisao/VinylMusicPlayer/releases).

## Additional features
* Android Auto support
* ReplayGain
* SD Card write access (requests all files access if running in Android 11+, if else, it uses SAF)
* Uses taglib for reading tags from music files
* No internet connectivity

## TODO
* Rework the directory picker (at the moment the app uses an outdated library for that)
* Rework the tag editor
