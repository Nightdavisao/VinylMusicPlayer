**A material designed local music player for Android.**

**Forked from [Phonograph](https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph); makes all Pro features free, as they used to be.**

## Download
Check [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nightdavisao/VinylMusicPlayer/releases).

## Additional features
* Android Auto support
* ReplayGain
* SD Card write access (requests all files access if running in Android 11+, if else, it uses SAF)
* Hopefully not a broken media session notification
* Uses taglib for reading tags from music files (though it still uses jaudiotagger for editing tags, using other apps for editing tags in meantime is advised!)
* Stuff may be broken so beware before trying out this fork (for example, "Scan media" feature is intentionally "broken" as I'm working in a whole new way to select folders in the app instead of using Material Dialogs)
* [...and more!](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
